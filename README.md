## About

I am a rising senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
My interests lie in web development, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence.  I am particularly fascinated by the advancement of models that underpin conversational AI systems,  including chatbots and intelligent digital interfaces, and am committed to enhancing their contextual understanding and resourcefulness.
      
I recently completed an internship at Microsoft, where I architected and implemented a Model Context Protocol Server to empower AI agents by provisioning them with dynamic, contextually relevant resources, thereby augmenting their problem-solving capabilities.
      
I love to play ping pong, watch YouTube, workout, or read in my free times.
