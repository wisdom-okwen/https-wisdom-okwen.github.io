## About

I am a rising senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, deeply passionate about leveraging technology to address complex, real-world challenges. My academic and professional journey has been defined by a relentless curiosity for web development—spanning frontend, backend, and API design—as well as a profound engagement with machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am particularly fascinated by the advancement of models that underpin conversational AI systems, including chatbots and intelligent digital interfaces, and am committed to enhancing their contextual understanding and resourcefulness.

Most recently, I completed a transformative internship at Microsoft, where I architected and implemented a Model Context Protocol Server. This system empowers AI agents within Microsoft Copilot Studio by provisioning them with dynamic, contextually relevant resources, thereby augmenting their problem-solving capabilities and adaptability. My work contributed to making AI agents more versatile and effective in real-world applications.

Beyond my technical pursuits, I find balance and inspiration through recreational activities such as playing ping pong, engaging with thought-provoking content on YouTube, maintaining physical fitness, and immersing myself in literature. These interests continually enrich my perspective and fuel my drive for lifelong learning and innovation.
